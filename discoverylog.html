        <h1>Discovery Log</h1>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>Most Useful Website -<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/">https://www.google.co.uk/</a></p>
        <p>I chose this as it is host to a vast amount of information that is easily accessible by both me and others, it’s easily accessible as it’s not very demanding on an internet connection or on the machine’s capability to load the downloaded web pages.</p>
        <p>Worst Website -<a target="_blank" href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/">http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/</a></p>
        <p>I have chosen this website for the worst website as the basic design techniques used on a website are lacking any polish. Also, it uses very bland colour schemes that almost makes you want to go to sleep.</p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>In terms of choosing a capable text editor, I have nominated to go for Atom. There are several reasons behind this, firstly, I have used this extensively in the past, but I am going to look into using Notepad++ or Brackets also.</p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>Social engineering is potent threat to our cyber security (refer to coursework 1 - Literature review (Mitigating Exposure of Personal Information Online).</p>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>The importance of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It is vastly superior than solely HTML as it can set rules for certain tags and allows you to define the meaning of tags, without having to duplicate a lot of code that just HTML would force you to use.</p>
        <code>p {
          background: red;
          color: white;
        }</code>
        <p>Here p is the selector, the thing the tag is selecting to change, you can use * to select EVERYTHING. Background and color are the attributes. Red and white are the properties.</p>
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>The term em’s comes from old printing press days where they would use the size of a capital ‘M’ in the current font to define how long the length of a sentence in going to be</p>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>In the worksheet for week 7 (week 1 of learning CSS), I learned how I can select a certain piece of a HTML document to apply some formatting to. See below HTML then CSS respectively, followed up with a picture of what is output as a result:</p>

    <div id="bgimg3">
      <div class="text">
        <section>
          <img class ="dl" src="images/codeExampleOutput.jpg" alt="The output of example code">
          <h2>Week 14</h2>
          <p>In week 14’s worksheet, I learned something quite useful regarding how I can utilise links in HTML5 and CSS. This being the _blank target function. This forces the link to be opened in a new tab or window (wholly dependant upon your browser and/or Operating System).</p>
          <h2>Week 15</h2>
          <p>In week 15's practical, we just carried on working on our personal websites. However, in the lecture we learned about what standards are, how they're made, and who by.</p>
          <h2>Week 16</h2>
          <p>Then, week 16 was a VERY important week. In both the lecture and worksheet we learned about usability. This includes things like; functionality - does the website work properly, learnability - does the website require the user to learn anything, design - is the website aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          <h2>Week 17</h2>
          <p>Following up on week 16 came accessibility in week 17. This covered a lot of very interesting topics. These being; visual - does it account for individuals who suffer from visual impairments by using text-to-speech or using readible colour combinations, mobility - does it allow for  a user with motor issues to still navigate the page easily, auditory - does the site enable users with auditory issues to be able to navigate the page and it's contects with the implementation of VTT files into videos.</p>
