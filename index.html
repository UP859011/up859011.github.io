      <p>Hello world! Welcome to my website. Here you will be able to find various pieces of work that I have completed and posted for all the world - or those with access to this file - to see. This includes works such as my "Discovery Log" for my Web Foundations unit, and also, my "Literature Review" on "Mitigating Exposure of Personal Information Online". On the left is an image of "The Kid" from one of my favourite games of all time... Bastion. In addition, you may or may not have noticed that the theme of the website is mountains. I love them, my goal in life is to climb them all. Yes, all of them! Having said that, I would also love to travel across the world and experience a variety of other cultures.</p>
