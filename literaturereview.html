      <h1>Mitigating Exposure of Personal Information Online</h1>
      <section>
        <p>The widespread adoption of social media in conjunction with more advanced devices - such as a laptop, or mobile - have lead to a very real danger to the exposure of personal information online, this is stated by (Chon, B.S., Lee, J., Jeong, H., Park, J., & Park, J. 2018). It was discovered that there were 182,666 cases of personal information leaks in South Korea alone - between 2006 and 2008 - (Mina Shim, Seungjo Baek, Taehyoung Park, Jeongseon Seol & Jongin Lim. 2009) which emphasises the need for action to be taken.

        <h2>The Threat Posed by the Exposure of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Chon also states in his study that at the time, the South Korean government stored approximately 64 million records of personal information on compact discs (CD’s). Which is a a major issue for personal information as it provides hackers a physical access point to the data, which through social engineering can be easily exploited, through well-intentioned people, allowing an intruder access to physical areas, passwords, and/or account numbers (Jackson, R. A. 2018). Social engineering can be executed in a variety of techniques, but the major ones are; intriguing emails, annoying social media messages, bogus package deliveries, spam calls with offers too good to be true, and tailgating. Where the aim of hackers is not “duping a single person for a single credit card number, it’s getting to the customer file for thousands of them”, where they can use these details to commit financial identity theft or some other illegal gain (Jackson, R. A. 2018). This is supported by Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J. (2016), found that these information security breaches are costing the global economy $445 billion, equivalent to 1% of total global income. They are able to do this for a number of reasons, firstly, through the use of online publications - corporate blogs and social media - hackers are able to piece together pieces of crucial data (Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J., 2016), allowing them to force employees to give them the information/access they want. There are a few reasons why it is even possible for hackers to be able to do this, firstly, as humans, we are social creatures, so when we do something exciting, or something bad happens to us, we want to share it to others. This causes a lot of personal information leaks, as we are seemingly committed to expressing ourselves (Chon, B.S., Lee, J., Jeong, H., Park, J., & Park, J. 2018).
        </p>
        <p>It is apparent however, that attackers don’t just do these things for no reason. In fact, financial gain is the second reason why these attacks occur (at 23% of the time). At 30%, most social engineering exploits occur because the individual committing them happens to have access to sensitive, privileged information, and 11% of the time it’s for recreational use (Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J., 2016). This is supported by Zhengchuan Xu; Qing Hu; Chenghong Zhang’s Why Computer Talents Become Computer Hackers from 2013. In this document, they find that people that start hacking do so because of available flaws in fundamental computing; the TCP/IP protocol suite, poor-security on a lot of local networks (be they through school, work etc.), as well as vulnerabilities in operating systems and web servers, giving them room to practice this path of computing. Especially considering that there is an apparent lack of prosecution of cyber-crimes, due to factors like; poor ability to collect evidence of a crime, and a judicial system that has not evolved to prosecute such offences (Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J., 2016).

        <h2>How to Mitigate Personal Information Exposure</h2>
        <p>There are however, measures that we can put into place to try and eliminate as much of the threat as possible, Mina et al have come up with technical countermeasures that organisations/institutions that collate personal information can implement for this purpose. Firstly, some specific implementations of encryption can be; for both file storage and transportation, and biometric verification. Similarly, for authenticating subjects, you can use two-factor authentication in conjunction with more advanced web certificates, to stop users accessing the site on an open public network, similar to Google’s approach with services akin to Drive. But one of the simplest technical options available is a tighter control on captured data, to ensure that only relevant data is collected and then stored within systems  - hackers can’t get your credit card info from your medical records for example (Mina Shim, Seungjo Baek, Taehyoung Park, Jeongseon Seol & Jongin Lim. 2009). Despite this, the human vulnerability remains the largest ‘chink-in-the-armour’, as there is no technical solution for it, spear phishing emails, messages, and phone calls all bypass this as they are designed to entice human beings on a more fundamental level. With females more likely to read an email that contains some form of malware, and males typically are victim to phishing appealing power, money, and sex (Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J., 2016, Page 33, Chapter 4). As it stands, the best defence against these social exploits is simply raising awareness, and regular education, to people of the numerous manipulation techniques, through various campaigns to reduce the success rates of these attacks, and stop attackers from amassing information that would enable them to exploit either people or organisations. One more vector of attack for hackers is tailgating, where the intruder closely follows another individual into a building that is normally unavailable to the public, allowing them physical access - massive issue in South Korea’s huge CD collection of personal information - to servers, files and more. This can be stopped however, by adding extra layers of on-site security, including but not limited to; security guards that check the ID of anyone entering the premises, the use of mantraps (a sort of air-lock) where the entering door must shut before the exit door opens, and placing and blatantly sign-posting security cameras to act as deterrence (Conteh, N. Y., & Schmick, P. J., 2016).
        </p>
        <p>To conclude, the exposure of personal information through the means of social engineering, and human error, are higher than ever, and costing the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars. To combat this people need to be more aware of what it is they upload onto the internet, as well as, institutions that are responsible for storing and protecting all this data, implementing more robust systems that are able to prevent these leaks from happening.</p>
