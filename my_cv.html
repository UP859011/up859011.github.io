                                On track to get a First-Class degree.<br><br>
                                My final year project centred around developing a practical mechanism to combat the crisis of democracy in the United Kingdom and abroad, and to support protest. As none of this is discussed in my degree curriculum, this experience also massively developed my researching skills.<br><br>
                                Elected to Course Representative for the University of Portsmouth in 2018.<br><br>
                                Member of several societies; IT society, Stand Up to Racism society, and Activists society.<br><br>
                                A very practical and coursework intensive degree, meaning I am accustomed to working under tight and overlapping deadlines while managing several workloads simultaneously.<br><br>
                                Developed a high competency with technology and software throughout this degree.<br><br>
                                Had to work independently and co-operatively on several occasions to solve problems, while being sure to adapt and grasp new concepts quickly.

                                Studied here as an international exchange student for one and a half semesters (disrupted by COVID-19).<br><br>
                                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I could not complete this placement, but I still received 20 credits in recognition of studying done.<br><br>
                                This experience really broadened my perspectives and made me much more interested in international news and events.<br><br>
                                Received an Erasmus scholarship.

                              Worked with several teams across the university and the union to write new policy and practice guidelines for a vast range of topics.<br><br>

                              Co-ordinated a social media presence to inform the students and the public of our activities.<br><br>
                              Maintained a constant and up to date knowledge base of social justice and issues of equality across the globe, and in the United Kingdom, to ensure effectiveness in our mission.<br><br>
                              Worked with external organisers to further racial equity within the local community and society that the university exists in.<br><br>
                              Lobbying the university itself to implement a Zero-Tolerance to Racism policy, while also doing micro-implementation to get as much of that policy put into practice.<br><br>
                              Worked alongside staff within the university and the student's union to implement policy changes that will close the awarding gap of local minority students.<br><br>
                              Co-ordinated several teams to try and tackle the awarding gap and racial inequity at the university from a faculty level as a more bottom-up approach.<br><br>
                              Attended several "panels" where matters of equality and diversity were discussed, as an opportunity to propagate changes that the student and staff body wanted to see.<br><br>
                              Ensure that my team were engaged, motivated, and mentally healthy. This involved arranging psychological support for those who needed it, due to discussing their racial trauma and the impact of micro-aggressions.<br><br>
                              Liaised with senior management and student representatives to gather data and research to use as evidence for policy and regulation changes.

                              Won the Vice-Chancellor's Award Commendation for running student-led campaigns to help tackle the BAME awarding gap at the university.<br><br>
                              Communicated with students from a BAME background to discover what changes would be the most beneficial for them.<br><br>
                              Helped university staff create course content that is more inclusive, and less exclusive or derogatory.
